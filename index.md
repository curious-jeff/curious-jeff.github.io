# Project One - Exploring eBay Car Sales data

* Using pandas dataframes, 50,000 rows of used car sales data were cleaned and explored
* Entries with extreme values in the `price` and `registration_year` was dropped
* The interaction between `price`, `odometer`, and `brand` was explored and tabulated
